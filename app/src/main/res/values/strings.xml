The goal of the puzzle is to place the tiles in numerical order. Named for the number of tiles in the frame, the 15 puzzle may also be called a 16 puzzle, alluding to its total tile capacity. Similar names are used for different sized variants of the 15 puzzle, such as the 8 puzzle that has 8 tiles in a 3×3 frame.This program was developed by Primqulov Bahrom, a student of the GITA educational center, to gain practical skills.</string>
